## Overview
  The Idea of building a chat web app always fascinate me ,and always seemed to me like a hard think to do, and in fact it is in some how there is some details thati missed there and some features wasn't clear how i could add using the technoligies that i know, but even tho i did a good job putting the idea from my head to the real world .

### The challenge
The Major Challenge with chat app is asynchronous grabbing of data from the database without refreshing and HTTP was a hole new thing before working on this project.

## My process
- i started with the idea design, i designed the wireframes and put the architecture : design syste including fonts ,color theory, the sizing and mesurement ,..
- then created the wireframes in figma and tried to make them perfect.
- tried to applicate the approach of seperating code that modifies in the semantic and the code that has logic in it.
- making php just manipulate the database in modules and returns just the raw data.


### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- CSS Variables
- Vanilla Javascript
- AJAX
- JQUERY
- PHP
- PHPMyAdmin
- Mysql

**Note: I didn't use any css framework or any fancy new js framwork ,even jquery i've used for very small tasks**

### What I learned
To Recap this project ,it's used to replicate the idea of whatsapp , i learned some pretty advanced stuff in js ,and understanding the workflow of javascript.


### Continued development

I need to work my ass in the reactive programming cause working with plain javascript can be painful. and using AJAX isn't the right way to do it when there is solutions like websocket out there.
